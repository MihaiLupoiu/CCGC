# Concepts Of Cloud And Grid Computing (Ccgc)
===================
Master's Degree in Parallel and Distributed Computing at Valencia (UPV)

The course provides students with the conceptual basis of the technologies currently used in distributed scientific computing infrastructure, focusing on Grid and Cloud. On the one hand, the course introduces students to the basics in terms of interfaces for launching remote work concepts, information systems and access to secondary storage resources through Grid security infrastructure. The course has a theoretical and practical and used as a base platform Globus Toolkit, which is the most widespread application of Grid at present content. Practices offer students the basic experience to create and use user and machine certificates amended Grid information system, launch remote jobs by GRAM interface and access remote files via GASS and GridFTP.
Moreover, the course introduces students to basic concepts on which the computation is based on Cloud Computing. The paper reviews the basic techniques of virtualization, cloud taxonomies and different types of deployments (public cloud versus private cloud). Finally, a practical part on a provider of public resources like Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure is performed. The practical part will allow students to experiment with the provision of virtualized resources and manual configuration thereof.
